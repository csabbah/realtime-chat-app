## Description

This application powered by Socket.io, allows users to communicate with each other in multiple rooms in real time. Through the use of utility functions, plain JavaScript, and Socket.io events, the chat experience is optimized. Features include the ability to see which users are typing in real time, a scroll to bottom button that appears when new messages are received, and notifications for when a user enters or exits the app. These and other features are made possible by dynamic updates to the user interface.
